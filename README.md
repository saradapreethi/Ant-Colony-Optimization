# Ant-Colony-Optimization
Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm to determine the shortest path in Travelling Salesman Problem

# Ant Colony Optimization(ACO):
Used to determine the shortest path between nodes.
Developed by observing the behaviour of ant when they follow a path to their food source.
Ant essentially follows the pheromone trails left by other ants on the path.
ACO determines the shortest path based on the probability of going to the next node.
Probability is dependent on: 1) Quality of the path (Distance to the next node) 2) Amount of pheromone deposited in the path.
